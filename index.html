        <p class="p-about">With each passing year there’s more agreement that our young people should enter adulthood financially literate.

It’s a break the glass moment in America. It’s time to gain mastery of money and finance, and to use it to chart a better course. It’s time to become FinanciaLit.</p>

            <p class="p-author">For the better part of two decades, educator, entrepreneur and author Tom Barrella has been keeping it real as the finance guru at one of America’s top high schools. Each year he and his business education colleagues teach hundreds of students in courses from personal finance to marketing to real estate law. He’s watched with concern as a confluence of factors pushes Americans closer and closer to the financial edge, striving to provide his students with the tools necessary to chart their own courses and build their lives on solid financial foundations.</p>
